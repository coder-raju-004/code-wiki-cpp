# X Window System
To access X11 you can use either Xlib or XCB. XCB offers more low-level functionality.

Available masks in /usr/include/X11/X.h
```cpp
#define ShiftMask		(1<<0)
#define LockMask		(1<<1)
#define ControlMask		(1<<2)
#define Mod1Mask		(1<<3)
#define Mod2Mask		(1<<4)
#define Mod3Mask		(1<<5)
#define Mod4Mask		(1<<6)
#define Mod5Mask		(1<<7)
```
You can find the constants for key symbols in /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h

Notable here is that in an XEvent keys are represented by a key code not to be confused with the keysym found in keysymdef.h.
Keysyms have to be converted into key codes using XKeysymToKeycode and can be converted back with XKeycodeToKeysym.
